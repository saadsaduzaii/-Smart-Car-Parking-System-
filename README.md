# IoT Based Smart Parking System



A smart parking system that utilizes IoT technology and Sonar sensors to detect vehicle presence in parking spaces. This repository contains the code of IOT-based Smart Parking System.

## Features

- **Sonar Sensors:** Utilizes two Sonar sensors strategically positioned to accurately detect the presence of vehicles, optimizing space utilization.
- **Real-time Updates:** Provides real-time parking space availability updates to users through the Android app interface.
- **Android App:** The Android app displays parking slot availability and enables users to book slots in advance.
- **Efficient Space Management:** Maximizes parking space utilization by detecting the widest part of vehicles for accurate occupancy detection.
- **Booking Feature:** Users can conveniently book parking slots using the Android app, reducing wait times.

## How It Works

1. The Sonar sensors detect the presence of vehicles within their detection range.
2. Data from the sensors is processed to determine parking space occupancy.
3. The Android app fetches real-time updates from the system and displays parking slot availability.
4. Users can select available slots and book them using the app's booking feature.
